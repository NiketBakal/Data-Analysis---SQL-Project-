# Data-Analysis---SQL-Project-
I've built an HR database using PostgreSQL, crafted SQL queries, and developed a testing document to ensure the quality of an HR Analytics dashboard in Tableau Desktop. This project highlights my skills in SQL, database management, and data visualization for HR insights. Check out the GitHub repository to see my work.
